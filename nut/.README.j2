A Network UPS Tools daemon to allow you to easily manage battery backup (UPS)
devices connected to your Home Assistant machine.

## About

The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide support
for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power Distribution
Units, Automatic Transfer Switch, Power Supply Units and Solar Controllers.

NUT provides many control and monitoring [features][nut-features], with a
uniform control and management interface.

More than 140 different manufacturers, and several thousands models
are [compatible][nut-compatible].

The Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is the combined effort of
many [individuals and companies][nut-acknowledgements].

Be sure to add a NUT Sensor to your `configuration.yaml` after starting the
add-on:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: nut
    name: "CyberPower 1500"
    host: {% if channel == "edge" -%}
            40817795
          {%- elif channel == "beta" -%}
            UNKNOWN
          {%- else -%}
            a0d7b954
          {%- endif -%}-nut
    username: nutty
    password: changeme
    resources:
      - battery.charge
      - battery.runtime
      - ups.load
      - ups.status
```

For more information on how to configure the NUT Sensor in Home Assistant
