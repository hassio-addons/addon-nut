# Home Assistant Community Add-on: Network UPS Tools

The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide support
for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power Distribution
Units, Automatic Transfer Switch, Power Supply Units and Solar Controllers.

NUT provides many control and monitoring [features][nut-features], with a
uniform control and management interface.

More than 140 different manufacturers, and several thousands models
are [compatible][nut-compatible].

The Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is the combined effort of
many [individuals and companies][nut-acknowledgements].

Be sure to add the NUT integration after starting the add-on.

**Note**: _The host `a0d7b954-nut` can be used to allow Home Assistant to
communicate directly with the addon_

For more information on how to configure the NUT integration in Home Assistant
see the [NUT integration documentation][nut-ha-docs].

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "Network UPS Tools" add-on in the Home Assistant add-on store
   and install it.
1. Install the "Network UPS Tools" add-on.
1. Configure the `users` and `devices` options.
1. Start the "Network UPS Tools" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "Network UPS Tools" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Configure the [NUT Integration][nut-ha-docs].

## Configuration

The add-on can be used with the basic configuration, with other options for more
advanced users.

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Network UPS Tools add-on configuration:

```yaml
users:
  - username: nutty
    password: changeme
    instcmds:
      - all
    actions: []
devices:
  - name: myups
    driver: usbhid-ups
    port: auto
    config: []
mode: netserver
shutdown_host: "false"
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the add-on and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `users`

This option allows you to specify a list of one or more users. Each user can
have its own privileges like defined in the sub-options below.

_Refer to the [`upsd.users(5)`][upsd-users] documentation for more information._

#### Sub-option: `username`

The username the user needs to use to login to the NUT server. A valid username
contains only `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9` and underscore characters (`_`).

#### Sub-option: `password`

Set the password for this user.

#### Sub-option: `instcmds`

A list of instant commands that a user is allowed to initiate. Use `all` to
grant all commands automatically.

#### Sub-option: `actions`

A list of actions that a user is allowed to perform. Valid actions are:

- `set`: change the value of certain variables in the UPS.
- `fsd`: set the forced shutdown flag in the UPS. This is equivalent to an
  "on battery + low battery" situation for the purposes of monitoring.

The list of actions is expected to grow in the future.

#### Sub-option: `upsmon`

Add the necessary actions for a `upsmon` process to work. This is either set to
`master` or `slave`. If creating an account for a `netclient` setup to connect
this should be set to `slave`.

### Option: `devices`

This option allows you to specify a list of UPS devices attached to your
system.

_Refer to the [`ups.conf(5)`][ups-conf] documentation for more information._

#### Sub-option: `name`

The name of the UPS. The name `default` is used internally, so you canâ€™t use
it in this file.

#### Sub-option: `driver`

This specifies which program will be monitoring this UPS. You need to specify
the one that is compatible with your hardware. See [`nutupsdrv(8)`][nutupsdrv]
for more information on drivers in general and pointers to the man pages of
specific drivers.

#### Sub-option: `port`

This is the serial port where the UPS is connected. The first serial port
usually is `/dev/ttyS0`. Use `auto` to automatically detect the port.

#### Sub-option: `config`

A list of additional [options][ups-fields] to configure for this UPS. The common
[`usbhid-ups`][usbhid-ups] driver allows you to distinguish between devices by
using a combination of the `vendor`, `product`, `serial`, `vendorid`, and
`productid` options:

```yaml
devices:
  - name: mge
    driver: usbhid-ups
    port: auto
    config:
      - vendorid = 0463
  - name: apcups
    driver: usbhid-ups
    port: auto
    config:
      - vendorid = 051d*
  - name: foocorp
    driver: usbhid-ups
    port: auto
    config:
      - vendor = "Foo.Corporation.*"
  - name: smartups
    driver: usbhid-ups
    port: auto
    config:
      - product = ".*(Smart|Back)-?UPS.*"
```

### Option: `mode`

Recognized values are `netserver` and `netclient`.

- `netserver`: Runs the components needed to manage a locally connected UPS and
  allow other clients to connect (either as slaves or for management).
- `netclient`: Only runs `upsmon` to connect to a remote system running as
  `netserver`.

### Option: `shutdown_host`

When this option is set to `true` on a UPS shutdown command, the host system
will be shutdown. When set to `false` only the add-on will be stopped. This is to
allow testing without impact to the system.

### Option: `list_usb_devices`

When this option is set to `true`, a list of connected USB devices will be
displayed in the add-on log when the add-on starts up. This option can be used
to help identify different UPS devices when multiple UPS devices are connected
to the system.

### Option: `remote_ups_name`

When running in `netclient` mode, the name of the remote UPS.

### Option: `remote_ups_host`

When running in `netclient` mode, the host of the remote UPS.

### Option: `remote_ups_user`

When running in `netclient` mode, the user of the remote UPS.

### Option: `remote_ups_password`

When running in `netclient` mode, the password of the remote UPS.

**Note**: _When using the remote option, the user and device options must still
be present, however they will have no effect_

### Option: `upsd_maxage`

Allows setting the MAXAGE value in upsd.conf to increase the timeout for
specific drivers, should not be changed for the majority of users.

### Option: `upsmon_deadtime`

Allows setting the DEADTIME value in upsmon.conf to adjust the stale time for
the monitor process, should not be changed for the majority of users.

### Option: `i_like_to_be_pwned`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows to you bypass the
HaveIBeenPwned password requirement by setting it to `true`.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest picking a stronger/safer password instead of
using this option! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication on the NUT server by setting it to `true` and leaving the
username and password empty.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

## Event Notifications

Whenever your UPS changes state, an event named `nut.ups_event` will be fired.
It's payload looks like this:

| Key           | Value                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ups_name`    | The name of the UPS as you configured it     |
| `notify_type` | The type of notification                     |
| `notify_msg`  | The NUT default message for the notification |

`notify_type` signifies what kind of notification it is.
See the below table for more information as well as the message that will be in
`notify_msg`. `%s` is automatically replaced by NUT with your UPS name.

| Type       | Cause                                                                 | Default Message                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ONLINE`   | UPS is back online                                                    | "UPS %s on line power"                             |
| `ONBATT`   | UPS is on battery                                                     | "UPS %s on battery"                                |
| `LOWBATT`  | UPS has a low battery (if also on battery, it's "critical")           | "UPS %s battery is low"                            |
| `FSD`      | UPS is being shutdown by the master (FSD = "Forced Shutdown")         | "UPS %s: forced shutdown in progress"              |
| `COMMOK`   | Communications established with the UPS                               | "Communications with UPS %s established"           |
| `COMMBAD`  | Communications lost to the UPS                                        | "Communications with UPS %s lost"                  |
| `SHUTDOWN` | The system is being shutdown                                          | "Auto logout and shutdown proceeding"              |
| `REPLBATT` | The UPS battery is bad and needs to be replaced                       | "UPS %s battery needs to be replaced"              |
| `NOCOMM`   | A UPS is unavailable (can't be contacted for monitoring)              | "UPS %s is unavailable"                            |
| `NOPARENT` | The process that shuts down the system has died (shutdown impossible) | "upsmon parent process died - shutdown impossible" |

This event allows you to create automations to do things like send a
[critical notification][critical-notif] to your phone:

```yaml
automations:
  - alias: "UPS changed state"
    trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: nut.ups_event
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
        data_template:
          title: "UPS changed state"
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.notify_msg }}"
          data:
            push:
              sound:
                name: default
                critical: 1
                volume: 1.0
```
